There are some remnants in the project of things I wanted to implement but didn't manage to, such as: .env for environment variables, global-setup & .auth folder for the test setup.
I didn't delete them, so I could show what I wanted to do if I had more time.
I have also wrote some notes in the tests and PageObjects.
Would have also liked to seperate locators from the page objects, I would open a 'locators' directory, and create json files for each PO, that will contains its locators.
General methods for making the code more readable also were planned (for assertions, locators, etc)
